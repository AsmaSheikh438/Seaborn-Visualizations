# 🎨 Seaborn Visualization Techniques

Welcome to the **Seaborn Visualization Techniques** repository! This project serves as a comprehensive guide to mastering data visualization using Seaborn, featuring various plot types with real-world datasets.

## 📂 Dataset Used
We have used the **HR Data** dataset (**hr_data.csv**), which includes employee-related insights such as salary, department, and work experience. This dataset helps to create meaningful business visualizations.

## 📊 Plots Covered

### 1. **Line Plot**
   - Used to display trends over time.
   - Example: Employee salary trends across different years.

### 2. **Bar Plot**
   - Used for categorical data comparison.
   - Example: Number of employees per department.

### 3. **Scatter Plot**
   - Shows relationships between two continuous variables.
   - Example: Relationship between salary and years of experience.

### 4. **Heatmap**
   - Displays correlation between numerical variables.
   - Example: Finding correlations between employee attributes.

### 5. **Box Plot**
   - Used to show distribution and outliers in data.
   - Example: Salary distribution by department.

### 6. **Violin Plot**
   - Combines box plot and density plot.
   - Example: Salary distribution comparison across genders.

### 7. **Pair Plot**
   - Visualizes pairwise relationships in data.
   - Example: Exploring multiple employee-related factors together.

## 🚀 Features
- Step-by-step explanations of each plot type.
- Hands-on implementation using Python and Seaborn.
- Real-world dataset for practical insights.
- Beginner-friendly explanations with structured guides.
