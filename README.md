# 🎨 Seaborn Visualization Techniques

Welcome to **Seaborn Visualization Techniques**, a comprehensive guide to mastering data visualization using Seaborn. This repository provides in-depth explanations and practical examples to help you create insightful visualizations effortlessly.

## 📂 Dataset Used
We have used the **SEABORN.csv** dataset, which contains multiple numerical and categorical variables, making it ideal for exploring different visualization techniques.

## 📈 Plots Covered

### 1. **Line Plot**
   - Displays trends over time.
   - Example: Variation in sales over months.

### 2. **Bar Plot**
   - Used for categorical data comparison.
   - Example: Sales comparison across different regions.

### 3. **Scatter Plot**
   - Shows relationships between two continuous variables.
   - Example: Relationship between sales and customer age.

### 4. **Histogram**
   - Visualizes the distribution of numerical data.
   - Example: Distribution of customer purchase amounts.

### 5. **Box Plot**
   - Displays data distribution and outliers.
   - Example: Salary distribution across departments.

### 6. **Violin Plot**
   - Combines a box plot and density plot.
   - Example: Distribution of product ratings.

### 7. **Pair Plot**
   - Plots pairwise relationships in a dataset.
   - Example: Correlation among different sales parameters.

### 8. **Heatmap**
   - Represents correlation between numerical variables.
   - Example: Correlation between sales, marketing spend, and revenue.

### 9. **Swarm Plot**
   - Displays categorical data distribution while avoiding overlap.
   - Example: Customer ratings across product categories.

### 🚀 Features
- Step-by-step explanations for each plot type.
- Hands-on implementation using Python and Seaborn.
- Real-world dataset for practical learning.
- Interactive and insightful visualizations.
